# monitoring_bitcoin
In this project, I want to be able to connect to my personal bitcoin node and extract whatever data I want from it. 
In particular balances linked to a key (pub, priv or master key), an estimate of the network hashrate, ...  (my own block explorer)

## 
I want to build a php server connected to the node throught RPC.
